Alzheimer's Disease ,"Cholinesterase inhibitors.These medicines work by boosting levels of cell-to-cell communication. The medicines preserve a chemical messenger that is depleted in the brain by Alzheimer's disease. These are usually the first medicines tried, and most people see modest improvements in symptoms.Cholinesterase inhibitors may improve symptoms related to behavior, such as agitation or depression. The medicines are taken orally or delivered through a patch on the skin. Commonly prescribed cholinesterase inhibitors include donepezil (Aricept, Adlarity), galantamine (Razadyne) and rivastigmine transdermal patch (Exelon).The main side effects of these drugs include diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite and sleep disturbances. In people with certain heart disorders, serious side effects may include an irregular heartbeat."
Alzheimer's Disease ,Memantine (Namenda).This medicine works in another brain cell communication network and slows the progression of symptoms with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. It's sometimes used in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Relatively rare side effects include dizziness and confusion.
Arboviral Encephalitis ,Bed rest.
Arboviral Encephalitis ,Plenty of fluids.
Arboviral Encephalitis ,"Anti-inflammatory medicines — such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) — to relieve headaches and fevers."
Arthritis ,"NSAIDs.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Examples include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). StrongerNSAIDscan cause stomach irritation and may increase your risk of heart attack or stroke.NSAIDsare also available as creams or gels, which can be rubbed on joints."
Arthritis ,"Counterirritants.Some varieties of creams and ointments contain menthol or capsaicin, the ingredient that makes hot peppers spicy. Rubbing these preparations on the skin over your aching joint may interfere with the transmission of pain signals from the joint itself."
Arthritis ,"Steroids.Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, reduce inflammation and pain and slow joint damage. Corticosteroids may be given as a pill or as an injection into the painful joint. Side effects may include thinning of bones, weight gain and diabetes."
Arthritis ,"Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).These drugs can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and save the joints and other tissues from permanent damage. In addition to conventionalDMARDs, there are also biologic agents and targeted syntheticDMARDs. Side effects vary but mostDMARDsincrease your risk of infections."
Asthma ,"Inhaled corticosteroids.These medications include fluticasone propionate (Flovent HFA, Flovent Diskus, Xhance), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Pulmicort Respules, Rhinocort), ciclesonide (Alvesco), beclomethasone (Qvar Redihaler), mometasone (Asmanex HFA, Asmanex Twisthaler) and fluticasone furoate (Arnuity Ellipta).You may need to use these medications for several days to weeks before they reach their maximum benefit. Unlike oral corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids have a relatively low risk of serious side effects."
Asthma ,"Leukotriene modifiers.These oral medications — including montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo) — help relieve asthma symptoms.Montelukast has been linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Seek medical advice right away if you experience any of these reactions."
Asthma ,"Combination inhalers.These medications — such as fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair HFA, Airduo Digihaler, others), budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort), formoterol-mometasone (Dulera) and fluticasone furoate-vilanterol (Breo Ellipta) — contain a long-acting beta agonist along with a corticosteroid."
Asthma ,"Theophylline.Theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophyllin, Theochron) is a daily pill that helps keep the airways open by relaxing the muscles around the airways. It's not used as often as other asthma medications and requires regular blood tests."
Bacterial Vaginosis ,"Metronidazole (Flagyl, Metrogel-Vaginal, others).This medicine comes as a pill or topical gel. You swallow the pill, but the gel is inserted into your vagina. Avoid alcohol while using this medicine and for a full day afterward. It might cause nausea or stomach pain. Check the instructions on the product."
Bacterial Vaginosis ,"Clindamycin (Cleocin, Clindesse, others).This medicine comes as a cream that you insert into the vagina. Or you can use the pill or suppository form. The cream and suppositories may weaken latex condoms. Avoid sex during treatment and for at least three days after you stop using the medicine. Or use another method of birth control."
Bacterial Vaginosis ,Tinidazole (Tindamax).You take this medicine by mouth. It can cause stomach upset. So avoid alcohol during treatment and for at least three days after completing treatment.
Bacterial Vaginosis ,"Secnidazole (Solosec).This is an antibiotic you eat one time with food. It comes as a packet of granules that you sprinkle onto a soft food, such as applesauce, pudding or yogurt. You eat the mixture within 30 minutes. But take care not to crunch or chew the granules."
Bladder Cancer ,"Surgery,to remove the cancer cells"
Bladder Cancer ,"Chemotherapy in the bladder (intravesical chemotherapy),to treat cancers that are confined to the lining of the bladder but have a high risk of recurrence or progression to a higher stage"
Bladder Cancer ,"Chemotherapy for the whole body (systemic chemotherapy),to increase the chance for a cure in a person having surgery to remove the bladder, or as a primary treatment when surgery isn't an option"
Bladder Cancer ,"Radiation therapy,to destroy cancer cells, often as a primary treatment when surgery isn't an option or isn't desired"
Bladder Cancer ,"Immunotherapy,to trigger the body's immune system to fight cancer cells, either in the bladder or throughout the body"
Bladder Cancer ,"Targeted therapy,to treat advanced cancer when other treatments haven't helped"
Breast Cancer ,Removing the breast cancer.A lumpectomy is surgery to remove the breast cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it. The rest of the breast tissue isn't removed. Other names for this surgery are breast-conserving surgery and wide local excision. Most people who have a lumpectomy also have radiation therapy.Lumpectomy might be used to remove a small cancer. Sometimes you can have chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the cancer so that lumpectomy is possible.
Breast Cancer ,"Removing all of the breast tissue.A mastectomy is surgery to remove all breast tissue from a breast. The most common mastectomy procedure is total mastectomy, also called simple mastectomy. This procedure removes all of the breast, including the lobules, ducts, fatty tissue and some skin, including the nipple and areola.Mastectomy might be used to remove a large cancer. It also might be needed when there are multiple areas of cancer within one breast. You might have a mastectomy if you can't have or don't want radiation therapy after surgery.Some newer types of mastectomy procedures might not remove the skin or nipple. For instance, a skin-sparing mastectomy leaves some skin. A nipple-sparing mastectomy leaves the nipple and the skin around it, called the areola. These newer operations can improve the look of the breast after surgery, but they aren't options for everyone."
Breast Cancer ,"Removing a few lymph nodes.A sentinel node biopsy is an operation to take out some lymph nodes for testing. When breast cancer spreads, it often goes to the nearby lymph nodes first. To see if the cancer has spread, a surgeon removes some of the lymph nodes near the cancer. If no cancer is found in those lymph nodes, the chance of finding cancer in any of the other lymph nodes is small. No other lymph nodes need to be removed."
Breast Cancer ,Removing several lymph nodes.Axillary lymph node dissection is an operation to remove many lymph nodes from the armpit. Your breast cancer surgery might include this operation if imaging tests show the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. It also might be used if cancer is found in a sentinel node biopsy.
Breast Cancer ,"Removing both breasts.Some people who have cancer in one breast may choose to have their other breast removed, even if it doesn't have cancer. This procedure is called a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. It might be an option if you have a high risk of getting cancer in the other breast. The risk might be high if you have a strong family history of cancer or have DNA changes that increase the risk of cancer. Most people with breast cancer in one breast will never get cancer in the other breast."
E. Coli ,Rest
E. Coli ,Fluids to help prevent dehydration and fatigue
Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV) ,Bed rest.
Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV) ,Plenty of fluids.
Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV) ,"Anti-inflammatory medicines — such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) — to relieve headaches and fevers."
Ehrlichiosis ,Gloves.Wear medical gloves or similar gloves if possible to protect your hands.
Ehrlichiosis ,"Tweezers.Use fine-tipped tweezers to grab the tick firmly near its head or mouth, and as close to the skin as possible."
Ehrlichiosis ,"Removal.Pull the tick's body away your skin steadily and slowly without jerking or twisting it. If parts of the mouth remain, remove them with clean tweezers."
Ehrlichiosis ,"Disposal.Kill the tick by putting it in alcohol. Do not crush the tick to avoid exposure to possible bacteria. The dead tick can be flushed, lightly wrapped in tape before throwing in the trash or stored in a freezer."
Ehrlichiosis ,"Storage.A tick can be tested at a later date if you suspect infection. Place the tick in a container, label it with the date, and place it in the freezer."
Ehrlichiosis ,Cleanup.Use soap and water to wash your hands after handling the tick and around the tick bite. Clean the site and your hands with rubbing alcohol.
Endometrial Cancer ,"Radiation from a machine outside your body.During external beam radiation, you lie on a table while a machine directs radiation to specific points on your body."
Endometrial Cancer ,"Radiation placed inside your body.Internal radiation, called brachytherapy, involves a radiation-filled device, such as small seeds, wires or a cylinder. This device is placed inside your vagina for a short period of time."
Fibroids ,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists.These treat fibroids by blocking the body from making the hormones estrogen and progesterone. This puts you into a temporary menopause-like state. As a result, menstrual periods stop, fibroids shrink and anemia often gets better.GnRHagonists include leuprolide (Lupron Depot, Eligard, others), goserelin (Zoladex) and triptorelin (Trelstar, Triptodur Kit).Many people have hot flashes while usingGnRHagonists. Often, these medicines are used for no more than six months. That's because symptoms return when the medicine is stopped, and long-term use can cause loss of bone. Sometimes,GnRHagonists are taken with low-dose estrogen or progestin. You might hear this called add-back therapy. It can ease side effects, and it might allow you to takeGnRHagonists up to 12 months.Your doctor may prescribe aGnRHagonist to shrink the size of your fibroids before a planned surgery. Or you might be prescribed this medicine to help transition you into menopause."
Fibroids ,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists.These medicines can treat heavy menstrual bleeding in people with uterine fibroids who haven't gone through menopause. But they don't shrink fibroids.GnRHantagonists can be used for up to two years. Taking them along with add-back therapy can lessen side effects such as hot flashes and bone loss. Sometimes, low-dose estrogen or progestin are already included in these medicines.GnRHantagonists include elagolix (Oriahnn) and relugolix (Myfembree)."
Fibroids ,"Progestin-releasing intrauterine device (IUD).A progestin-releasingIUDcan relieve heavy bleeding caused by fibroids. It only relieves symptoms, though. It doesn't shrink fibroids or make them go away. It also prevents pregnancy."
Fibroids ,"Tranexamic acid (Lysteda, Cyklokapron).This nonhormonal medicine can ease heavy menstrual periods. You take it only on heavy bleeding days."
Fibroids ,"Other medicines.Your doctor might recommend other medicines. For example, low-dose birth control pills can help control menstrual bleeding. But they don't reduce fibroid size.Medicines called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help relieve pain tied to fibroids, but they don't reduce bleeding caused by fibroids.NSAIDsaren't hormonal medicines. Examples include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Your doctor also may suggest that you take vitamins and iron if you have heavy menstrual bleeding and anemia."

Genital Herpes ,Lower the frequency of recurrent outbreaks
Genital Herpes ,Lessen the severity and duration of symptoms in recurrent outbreaks
Genital Herpes ,Reduce the chance of passing the herpes virus to a partner
Incontinence ,"Bladder training,to delay urination after you get the urge to go. You may start by trying to hold off for 10 minutes every time you feel an urge to urinate. The goal is to lengthen the time between trips to the toilet until you're urinating only every 2.5 to 3.5 hours."
Incontinence ,"Double voiding,to help you learn to empty your bladder more completely to avoid overflow incontinence. Double voiding means urinating, then waiting a few minutes and trying again."
Incontinence ,"Scheduled toilet trips,to urinate every two to four hours rather than waiting for the need to go."
Incontinence ,"Fluid and diet management,to regain control of your bladder. You may need to cut back on or avoid alcohol, caffeine or acidic foods. Reducing liquid consumption, losing weight or increasing physical activity also can ease the problem."
Influenza (Flu) ,"Drink plenty of liquids.Choose water, juice and warm soups to prevent dehydration."
Influenza (Flu) ,"Rest.Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection. You may need to change your activity level, depending on your symptoms."
Influenza (Flu) ,"Consider pain relievers.Use acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), to combat the fever, headache or achiness associated with influenza. Children and teens recovering from flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal condition."
Kidney Cancer ,"Removing the affected kidney (nephrectomy).A complete (radical) nephrectomy involves removing the entire kidney, a border of healthy tissue and occasionally additional nearby tissues such as the lymph nodes, adrenal gland or other structures.The surgeon may perform a nephrectomy through a single incision in the abdomen or side (open nephrectomy) or through a series of small incisions in the abdomen (laparoscopic or robotic-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy)."
Kidney Cancer ,"Removing the tumor from the kidney (partial nephrectomy).Also called kidney-sparing or nephron-sparing surgery, the surgeon removes the cancer and a small margin of healthy tissue that surrounds it rather than the entire kidney. It can be done as an open procedure, or laparoscopically or with robotic assistance.Kidney-sparing surgery is a common treatment for small kidney cancers and it may be an option if you have only one kidney. When possible, kidney-sparing surgery is generally preferred over a complete nephrectomy to preserve kidney function and reduce the risk of later complications, such as kidney disease and the need for dialysis."
Leukemia ,"Chemotherapy.Chemotherapy is the major form of treatment for leukemia. This drug treatment uses chemicals to kill leukemia cells.Depending on the type of leukemia you have, you may receive a single drug or a combination of drugs. These drugs may come in a pill form, or they may be injected directly into a vein."
Leukemia ,"Targeted therapy.Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you."
Leukemia ,"Radiation therapy.Radiation therapy uses X-rays or other high-energy beams to damage leukemia cells and stop their growth. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a large machine moves around you, directing the radiation to precise points on your body.You may receive radiation in one specific area of your body where there is a collection of leukemia cells, or you may receive radiation over your whole body. Radiation therapy may be used to prepare for a bone marrow transplant."
Leukemia ,"Bone marrow transplant.A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.Prior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive an infusion of blood-forming stem cells that help rebuild your bone marrow.You may receive stem cells from a donor or you may be able to use your own stem cells."
Leukemia ,Immunotherapy.Immunotherapy uses your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that help them hide from the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.
Leukemia ,"Engineering immune cells to fight leukemia.A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.CAR-T cell therapy might be an option for certain types of leukemia."
Leukemia ,"Clinical trials.Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments. While clinical trials give you or your child a chance to try the latest cancer treatment, treatment benefits and risks may be uncertain. Discuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your doctor."
Liver Cancer ,"Surgery to remove the tumor.In certain situations, your doctor may recommend an operation to remove the liver cancer and a small portion of healthy liver tissue that surrounds it if your tumor is small and your liver function is good.Whether this is an option for you also depends on the location of your cancer within the liver, how well your liver functions and your overall health."
Liver Cancer ,"Liver transplant surgery.During liver transplant surgery, your diseased liver is removed and replaced with a healthy liver from a donor. Liver transplant surgery is only an option for a small percentage of people with early-stage liver cancer."
Lung Cancer ,Wedge resectionto remove a small section of lung that contains the cancer along with a margin of healthy tissue.
Lung Cancer ,"Segmental resectionto remove a larger portion of lung, but not an entire lobe."
Lung Cancer ,Lobectomyto remove the entire lobe of one lung.
Lung Cancer ,Pneumonectomyto remove an entire lung.
Meningitis ,Bed rest.
Meningitis ,Plenty of fluids.
Meningitis ,Pain medicine to help reduce fever and relieve body aches.

Meningococcal Disease ,Plenty of fluids.
Meningococcal Disease ,Pain medicine to help reduce fever and relieve body aches.
Multiple Myeloma ,"Targeted therapy.Targeted therapy uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die."
Multiple Myeloma ,Immunotherapy.Immunotherapy is a treatment with medicine that helps the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. The immune system fights off diseases by attacking germs and other cells that shouldn't be in the body. Cancer cells survive by hiding from the immune system. Immunotherapy helps the immune system cells find and kill the cancer cells.
Multiple Myeloma ,"CAR-T cell therapy.Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, also called CAR-T cell therapy, trains your immune system cells to fight multiple myeloma. This treatment begins with removing some white blood cells, including T cells, from your blood. The cells are sent to a lab. In the lab, the cells are treated so that they make special receptors. The receptors help the cells recognize a marker on the surface of the myeloma cells.Then the cells are put back into your body. They can now find and destroy the multiple myeloma cells."
Multiple Myeloma ,"Chemotherapy.Chemotherapy uses strong medicines to kill cancer cells. The medicines kill fast-growing cells, including myeloma cells."
Multiple Myeloma ,"Corticosteroids.Corticosteroid medicines help control swelling and irritation, called inflammation, in the body. They also work against myeloma cells."
Multiple Myeloma ,"Bone marrow transplant.A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, replaces diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow.Before a bone marrow transplant, blood-forming stem cells are collected from your blood. High doses of chemotherapy then are given to destroy your diseased bone marrow. Then the stem cells are put into your body. They travel to the bones and begin rebuilding bone marrow. This type of transplant using your own cells is called an autologous bone marrow transplant.Sometimes the stem cells come from a healthy donor. This type of transplant is called an allogenic bone marrow transplant."
Multiple Myeloma ,"Radiation therapy.Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to kill cancer cells. The energy can come from X-rays, protons or other sources. Radiation can quickly shrink a growth of myeloma cells. It might be used if myeloma cells form a mass called a plasmacytoma. Radiation may help control a plasmacytoma that's causing pain or destroying a bone."
Sarcoidosis ,"Corticosteroids.These powerful anti-inflammatory drugs are usually the first line treatment for sarcoidosis. In some cases, corticosteroids can be applied directly to an affected area — via a cream to a skin lesion or drops to the eyes."
Sarcoidosis ,"Medications that suppress the immune system.Medications such as methotrexate (Trexall) and azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) reduce inflammation by suppressing the immune system."
Sarcoidosis ,Hydroxychloroquine.Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) may be helpful for skin lesions and elevated blood-calcium levels.
Sarcoidosis ,Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors.These medications are commonly used to treat the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis. They can also be helpful in treating sarcoidosis that hasn't responded to other treatments.
Endometrial Cancer ,"Radiation from a machine outside your body.During external beam radiation, you lie on a table while a machine directs radiation to specific points on your body."
Endometrial Cancer ,"Radiation placed inside your body.Internal radiation, called brachytherapy, involves a radiation-filled device, such as small seeds, wires or a cylinder. This device is placed inside your vagina for a short period of time."
Vaginitis ,"Metronidazole (Flagyl, Metrogel-Vaginal, others).This medicine comes as a pill or topical gel. You swallow the pill, but the gel is inserted into your vagina. Avoid alcohol while using this medicine and for a full day afterward. It might cause nausea or stomach pain. Check the instructions on the product."
Vaginitis ,"Clindamycin (Cleocin, Clindesse, others).This medicine comes as a cream that you insert into the vagina. Or you can use the pill or suppository form. The cream and suppositories may weaken latex condoms. Avoid sex during treatment and for at least three days after you stop using the medicine. Or use another method of birth control."
Vaginitis ,Tinidazole (Tindamax).You take this medicine by mouth. It can cause stomach upset. So avoid alcohol during treatment and for at least three days after completing treatment.
Vaginitis ,"Secnidazole (Solosec).This is an antibiotic you eat one time with food. It comes as a packet of granules that you sprinkle onto a soft food, such as applesauce, pudding or yogurt. You eat the mixture within 30 minutes. But take care not to crunch or chew the granules."
Wilson's Disease,"Penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen).Penicillamine is a copper chelating agent. It can cause serious side effects, including skin and kidney issues, and worsen nervous system symptoms. It also can cause bone marrow suppression, so bone marrow can't make enough red blood cells and platelets. Use penicillamine cautiously if you have a penicillin allergy. It also keeps vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) from working. That means you'll need to take a B6 supplement in small doses."
Wilson's Disease,"Trientine (Cuvrior, Syprine).Another copper chelation agent called trientine works much like penicillamine, but it tends to cause fewer side effects. Still, nervous system symptoms can get worse when taking trientine."
Wilson's Disease,Zinc acetate (Galzin).This medicine stops your body from absorbing copper from the food you eat. It's usually used to stop copper from building up again after treatment with penicillamine or trientine. Zinc acetate might be used as the main therapy if you can't take penicillamine or trientine after completing therapy to remove excess copper or if you have no symptoms. Zinc acetate can upset your stomach.
